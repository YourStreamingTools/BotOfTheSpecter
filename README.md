### Version 5.4
[See everything that's new in Version 5.4](https://changelog.botofthespecter.com/5.4.html)
 
### Upcoming: v6 — Complete rewrite (TwitchIO 3.1.0)

We are planning a complete rewrite of the bot system for v4.0.0, migrating the codebase to TwitchIO 3.1.0. This is a ground-up refactor and may include substantial architectural changes.

## BotOfTheSpecter Versioning Rules (since v2.5.0)

The version number is written as major.minor.micro (e.g., 3.2.1).

### Major

Increases by 1 for each new release.

When it increases, the minor part resets to 0.

### Minor

Increases by 1 for each new release, as long as the major number stays the same.

Resets to 0 whenever the major number changes.

### Micro

Normally 0 for releases.

Increases by 1 only if a fix (patch) is pushed for that same version.

### Important note

A higher major number doesn’t necessarily mean the release has big or breaking changes. Backward-incompatible changes can happen in any release, whether major or minor.
