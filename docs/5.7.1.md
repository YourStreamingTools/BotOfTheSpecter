## Version Information

* Updated version from 5.7 to 5.7.1
* Code cleanup and environment variable management improvements

## Code Improvements & Cleanup

* **Removed Legacy Backup System Code**
  * Eliminated `USE_BACKUP_SYSTEM` and `BACKUP_SYSTEM` variables and all related conditional logic
  * Simplified OAuth token and client credential configuration to use single code path
  * Removed backup system checks from token refresh, API user ID assignments, and message filtering
  * Cleaned up conditional branching that was no longer needed in the bot system

* **Enhanced Environment Variable Reloading**
  * Added missing environment variables to `reload_env_vars` function for complete midnight refresh:
    * `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API access
    * `SSH_USERNAME` - SSH authentication username
    * `SSH_PASSWORD` - SSH authentication password
    * `SSH_HOSTS` - Complete dictionary of all 9 host configurations (API, WEBSOCKET, BOT-SRV, SQL, STREAM servers, WEB, BILLING)
  * Ensures all environment variables are properly reloaded during the midnight routine across all three bot systems

* **Removed Deprecated Variables**
  * Removed `OPENAI_VECTOR_ID` variable as it is no longer used in the codebase
  * Cleaned up all references from initialization, global declarations, and reload functions

## Technical Details
