# Changelog - Version 5.7.3 (2026-01-28)

## Version Information

* Updated version from 5.7.2 to 5.7.3
* Critical bug fix for AI response functionality

## Bug Fixes

* **Fixed AI Self-Response Loop Issue**
  * Resolved issue where AI was responding to its own messages
  * Added check to prevent AI from processing messages sent by itself
  * When the AI includes `@botofthespecter` in its responses, it will no longer trigger another AI response
  * Prevents infinite loop of the bot talking to itself

## Technical Details

* The AI response handler was checking for bot mentions (`@botofthespecter`) but wasn't verifying if the message author was the bot itself
* Added early return check: `if message.author.name.lower() == self.nick.lower()`
* The check logs the event with "Ignoring AI mention from bot itself" for debugging purposes
* Check is placed immediately after detecting the bot mention but before processing the message
* This ensures efficient early exit before any AI response generation occurs
