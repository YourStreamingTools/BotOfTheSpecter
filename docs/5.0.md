## Enhancements & Updates

* Updated `VERSION` variable to "5.0".
* **Premium Feature Gating:** Implemented a check (`check_premium_feature`) to determine user subscription status and grant access to premium features accordingly.
* **Song Command:** The `!song` command is now a premium feature, requiring at least a Tier 1 subscription to use.
* **Weather Command:** The `!weather` command is now a premium feature, requiring at least a Tier 1 subscription to use.
* **AI Features:** All AI-powered features are now premium, requiring at least a Tier 2 subscription to use.
* **AutoMod Integration:** Added a Twitch Event Sub integration for "automod.message.hold", "channel.suspicious_user.message" and "channel.chat.user_message_hold" to automatically ban users whose messages are held by AutoMod for matching known spam patterns. This ensures consistent spam protection even when messages are caught in the AutoMod queue.
* **Improved Mod Event Handling:** Enhanced the handling of 'channel.moderate' events to be more robust and prevent missing Discord notifications. This includes using `.get()` with default values to avoid potential errors from missing data and adding logging for incomplete events to aid in debugging.
* **Custom Command Variables:** Introduced more custom command variables to enhance bot responses with dynamic elements.
  * **Random Percentage:** `(random.percent)` generates a random percentage between 0 and 100. You can also specify a range using `(random.percent.x-y)`, where x and y are the lower and upper bounds.
  * **Random Number:** `(random.number)` generates a random number between 0 and 100.  Similar to the percentage variable, you can define a range with `(random.number.x-y)`.
  * **Random Pick:** `(random.pick.item1.item2.item3)` randomly selects and inserts one of the provided items. Separate each item with a period.
  * **Math:** `(math.x+y)` evaluates the mathematical expression and inserts the result. Currently supports basic arithmetic operations.
* **Subathon Timer System:** Fixed and improved the subathon timer system.
  * Added automatic time addition from Twitch Cheer and Twitch Sub events.
