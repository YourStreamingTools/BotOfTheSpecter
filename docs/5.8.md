# Changelog - Version 5.8 (UPCOMING UPDATE)

## Version Information

* Updated version from 5.7.4 to 5.8
* Major architecture improvements and custom bot support

## New Features & Major Changes

* **Custom Bot Mode Support**
  * Added support for running the bot with custom bot accounts via database credentials
  * New `-botusername` command line argument for specifying custom bot username
  * Automatic credential fetching from `custom_bots` table in website database
  * Dynamic OAuth token selection based on bot mode (custom vs standard)
  * Comprehensive validation checks before bot initialization

* **AI-Powered Ad Break Notifications**
  * Integrated GPT-5-nano for generating contextual ad break messages
  * AI analyzes recent chat history to create personalized ad break announcements
  * Tracks ad break count per stream session for smarter messaging
  * Premium tier 2+ feature with automatic fallback to standard messages
  * Clears ad-break chat history immediately at the start/end of ad handling — always cleared even when AI ad-breaks are disabled or the user lacks AI permission, preventing accumulation of stale messages across streams
  * Filters out timed messages from AI context while preserving command responses
  * Includes stream title and game context for better awareness
  * Replaced fixed post-ad sleep with active polling to detect the next scheduled ad faster — the bot now polls the Twitch Ads API every 10 seconds (for up to 5 minutes) after an ad completes and will send an immediate "next-ad" notification if the next ad is scheduled within 5 minutes.
  * Increased ad-check responsiveness by reducing the background check interval to 10 seconds, improving reliability of 5‑minute upcoming ad notifications and reducing missed or late alerts.
  * Improved error handling and logging for ad polling: non-200 responses and JSON parse failures are logged and retried during the poll period (no silent failures); duplicate notifications are prevented using the `ad_upcoming_notified` flag and `last_notification_time`.

* **Enhanced Ad Break Configuration**
  * Added individual toggle controls for each ad message type (upcoming, start, end, snoozed)
  * New database fields: `enable_upcoming_ad_message`, `enable_start_ad_message`, `enable_end_ad_message`, `enable_snoozed_ad_message`, `enable_ai_ad_breaks`
  * Improved ad break messaging logic with granular control
  * Better logging for ad notification debugging

* **Unified Points Management System**
  * New `manage_user_points()` function for centralized point operations
  * Supports get, credit, and debit actions with consistent return structure
  * Automatic user creation in bot_points table if not exists
  * Comprehensive error handling with detailed response objects
  * Prevents negative point balances

* **Improved Shoutout System**
  * New `get_shoutout_message()` function with game information integration
  * Different behavior for raid vs command-triggered shoutouts
  * Fetches latest stream game automatically for richer shoutout messages
  * Graceful fallback when game information unavailable
  * **Fixed shoutout queue blocking bug**: Reordered cooldown checks to prevent queue blocking when users are on per-user cooldown
    * Per-user cooldown (60 min) now checked before global cooldown (2 min) wait
    * Users on cooldown are skipped immediately without blocking other users in queue
    * Allows multiple different users to be shouted out every 2 minutes while respecting per-user limits
  * **Fixed `channel.shoutout.create` EventSub notification handling**
    * Fixed bug where `shoutout_user.lower()` was being called on a dictionary
    * Now properly detects command-triggered vs manual/UI-triggered shoutouts
    * Command-triggered shoutouts skip EventSub message to prevent duplicates
    * Manual/UI-triggered shoutouts now properly send chat messages via EventSub
    * Uses `get_shoutout_message()` function with "eventsub" action for consistent messaging
    * Fixed typo: "inforamtion" → "information" in error message

* **Channel-point VIP grants**
  * Added support for channel-point reward placeholders `(vip)` and `(vip.today)` in reward `custom_message`.
    * `(vip)` — immediately grants the redeemer a Twitch VIP (uses Helix POST `/channels/vips`).
    * `(vip.today)` — grants VIP and records the redeemer in a per-user `vip_today` table; the bot will automatically remove these VIPs when the stream goes offline (Helix DELETE `/channels/vips`).
  * Database: added per-channel `vip_today` table (columns: `user_id`, `username`, `added_at`) and migration to `dashboard/usr_database.php`.
  * Safety: bot logs failures, notifies chat on error, and prunes `vip_today` after attempting removals to avoid retries.
  * Rate-limits: removals are rate-aware (small delay between deletes) and failures are logged for manual follow-up.
  * Use case: add `(vip.today)` to a channel-point reward message to grant a time-limited VIP until stream end.

* **Raffle System**
  * Added a new raffle system enabling streamers to run raffles via both chat and the dashboard.
  * Entry method: Free chat command (`!joinraffle`); raffles may be started with an optional `weighted` flag so subscribers receive improved odds.
  * Commands: `!startraffle <name> <duration_minutes> [weighted]` to start, `!joinraffle` to enter, `!leaveraffle` to remove your entry, and `!drawraffle [raffle_id]` for mods to draw winners.
  * Dashboard: New `dashboard/raffles.php` page to create, view, and draw raffles from the UI (draw triggers a websocket notify).
  * API/WebSocket: Added `/websocket/raffle_winner` API endpoint and `RAFFLE_WINNER` websocket event; drawer updates database, bot announces winner in chat and notifies overlays.
  * Database: Added per-channel tables `raffles` and `raffle_entries` to store raffle metadata and entries.
  * Notes/Future: CSV export of entries, scheduled auto-draw and channel-points/bot-points entry costs are planned as optional enhancements.

* **Raid Analytics & Outgoing Raid Tracking**
  * Incoming raids are tracked in `raid_data` and `analytic_raids` (source: 'received'): raid counts and viewer totals are aggregated per raider, and stream credits are recorded.
  * Outgoing (sent) raids are detected when the broadcaster initiates a raid; the bot captures the viewer count, holds the raid data until the stream goes offline to ensure accurate viewer persistence, and then inserts a record into `analytic_raids` with source 'sent'.
  * Outgoing raids are canceled if an 'unraid' is received before persistence; a background task waits for stream offline to persist the raid.
  * Points, raid alerts, stream markers, and optional shoutouts continue to be handled for raid events as before.

* **Known Users Timestamps**
  * Added `first_seen` and `last_seen` DATETIME columns to the `seen_users` table (nullable).
  * Bot behavior: `first_seen` is set to the current timestamp the first time a user is observed; `last_seen` is updated on every message.
  * Dashboard: `Known Users` page now displays First Seen/Last Seen columns and shows "Unknown" when timestamps are missing.
  * Migration: existing `last_seen` values are used to populate `first_seen` when appropriate.

* **URL Blocking System Overhaul**
  * **Blacklist Always Active**: Blacklisted URLs are now blocked regardless of URL blocking setting
    * Blacklist check happens first before any other URL validation
    * Sends "Code Red" alert to mods when blacklisted URL is detected
    * Ensures harmful/unwanted URLs are always blocked
  * **Regex Support for Whitelist**: Whitelist now supports full regex pattern matching
    * Allows flexible URL pattern matching (e.g., `.*\.example\.com` for subdomains)
    * Backwards compatible - can still use simple domain names
    * Invalid regex patterns are logged and skipped gracefully
  * **Improved Privilege Handling**: Mods and streamers bypass URL blocking when enabled
    * Clearer logging for privileged user URL allowances
    * Permit command functionality preserved
  * **Enhanced URL Blocking Logic**:
    * **Enabled**: Removes all links except whitelisted regex patterns and Twitch links
    * **Disabled**: Allows all URLs except blacklisted ones
    * Twitch.tv and clips.twitch.tv links always allowed when URL blocking enabled
  * **Better Logging**: More descriptive log messages for URL blocking decisions
    * Logs when blacklisted URLs are detected
    * Logs when URLs are allowed due to whitelist match
    * Logs when URLs are allowed due to mod/streamer privilege
    * Logs when non-whitelisted URLs are blocked

* **Text Term Blocking System**
  * **New Feature**: Block specific words from chat
  * Messages containing blocked terms are automatically deleted
  * Case-insensitive matching (e.g., "badword", "BADWORD", "BadWord" all match)
  * Independent enable/disable toggle separate from URL blocking
  * Single word per entry validation (no spaces allowed)
  * **Database Tables**:
    * Added `term_blocking` column to `protection` table (VARCHAR(500), default: 'False')
    * New `blocked_terms` table to store blocked terms list
  * **Dashboard Integration**:
    * New Term Blocking section in Chat Protection tab
    * Add/remove blocked terms with simple interface
    * Real-time validation prevents:
      * Adding terms that match global spam patterns
      * Adding terms already in URL whitelist or blacklist
      * Adding multi-word phrases (spaces not allowed)
    * Validation with 500ms debounce for better performance
    * Empty state messaging when no terms are configured
  * **Bot Logic**:
    * Scans all chat messages for blocked terms when enabled
    * Deletes messages containing blocked terms instantly
    * Sends notification to user explaining removal
    * Independent from URL blocking - can be enabled separately
  * **Bug fix**: Fixed intermittent "Cursor closed" errors by using a dedicated DB connection+cursor for blocked-terms checks (no longer reuses cursors that may have been released).

## Code Improvements

* **Database Connection Refactoring**
  * Reworked MySQL handler to use connection pooling with `aiomysql.create_pool()` (on-demand pools per DB)
  * Pools perform health checks (ping on acquire) and will recreate themselves if connections are unhealthy
  * Added retry logic for acquiring a connection and tracking of pool `last_used` for idle cleanup
  * Implemented `cleanup_idle_pools()` to automatically close pools idle for more than 30 minutes and `close_all()` for shutdown
  * Created `PoolConnectionWrapper` for async context manager support; existing `mysql_handler.get_connection()` usage remains compatible
  * Added `get_pool_stats()` and `get_pool_status()` for diagnostics/logging
  * Still supports multi-database connections (user DB, website DB, spam_pattern DB)

* **Chat Message Enhancements**
  * Increased maximum message length from 255 to 500 characters
  * Updated `send_chat_message()` to support three bot modes:
    * **Self Mode** (`-self`): Uses broadcaster's own account as the bot
    * **Custom Mode** (`-custom`): Uses custom bot account from database credentials
    * **Standard Mode**: Uses main "botofthespecter" bot account
  * Dynamic sender_id and access_token selection based on active mode
  * Automatic BOT_USERNAME assignment (channel name for self mode, custom name for custom mode)
  * Improved error logging for failed message delivery
  * **Reliability fixes**:
    * `send_chat_message()` now uses a shared aiohttp `ClientSession` (lazy-created) to reduce transient connection churn and is closed on shutdown
    * Added retries and small backoff for transient network/server errors (502, 503, 504) and for transient aiohttp connection errors
    * Parses response body inside the request context (avoids accessing closed response objects) and uses parsed JSON/text in logs for better diagnostics
    * Custom-bot token refresh/retry flow integrated with the request retry logic to reduce failed send attempts

* **Event Processing**
  * New `process_chat_message_event()` helper function for consistent event handling
  * Orchestrates message counting, welcome messages, and point awarding
  * Simplified event processing from EventSub notifications
  * Provides centralized logging for all chat message events

* **Command Management Reliability**
  * Fixed `!enablecommand` and `!disablecommand` failures caused by an uninitialized `cooldown_bucket` when command configuration rows were missing.
  * Added safe cooldown defaults and kept DB lookups/updates inside an active cursor scope to prevent runtime command execution errors.
  * Improved target command parsing for these commands by normalizing input (trim, remove leading `!`, lowercase).
  * Enhanced `(customapi.*)` variable handling so placeholders inside custom API URLs (for example `(user)`) are resolved before the API request is made.
  * Improved custom API placeholder parsing to correctly handle nested parentheses in URLs, preventing truncated requests.

* **Logging Improvements**
  * Changed multiple `warning` level logs to `error` for better issue visibility
  * Enhanced startup logging with detailed bot configuration information
  * Added comprehensive initialization logs showing channel, username, system, and version
  * Better error context in ad break notification failures

* **MySQL Query Updates**
  * Updated `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` syntax to MySQL 8.0+ compatible format
  * Changed from `VALUES()` function to table alias syntax (`AS new_watch_time`)
  * Improved watch_time tracking query for better compatibility

* **SSH Manager Initialization**
  * Changed SSH manager logger from `bot_logger` to `system_logger` for better categorization
