# Version 2.5 (2024-03-17)

## Changed

* **Twitch Integration**
  * Updated Twitch PubSub and EventSubs integration. 
  * Modified client initialization from `twitchio.Client(token=TWITCH_API_AUTH)` to `twitchio.Client(token=CHANNEL_AUTH)`.
  * Changed `pubsub_pool.subscribe_channel(...)` to `pubsub_pool.subscribe_to_channel(...)` for better clarity and fixed method naming.
  * Added error handling and event logging to the PubSub event handler.

## Added

* Introduced a constructor under `class Bot(commands.Bot):` to initialize the bot with specific parameters such as token, prefix, initial channels, and nickname.
* Added a global function update in refresh token commands, changing from `global OAUTH_TOKEN, REFRESH_TOKEN` to `global CHANNEL_AUTH, REFRESH_TOKEN` for correct token handling.
* Included an error catch for the TwitchAPI in the `cheerleader_command` to handle `401 Unauthorized` responses gracefully.
* New command `mybits` to fetch and display the total bits given by a user.
  * Improved the bits display format in the `mybits` command for better readability.
* Introduced a `roadmap` command to share the bot development roadmap.
* Expanded the built-in commands list to include new commands `roadmap` and `mybits`.

## Removed

* Eliminated an unnecessary `pubsub_client` instantiation which was redundant after updates.

## Fixes

* Corrected various token references and method calls to ensure compatibility and functionality with the Twitch API.
* Fixed incorrect variable usages and streamlined the authentication process for the bot to work seamlessly.
