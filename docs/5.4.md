# Changelog - Version 5.4 (2025-09-20)

## Version Information

*This is the largest update that we've done to date -- the many changes in the following new version take into account 90% of community-requested changes.*

* Updated version from 5.3 to 5.4
* Improved version and system identifier handling
* Enhanced environment variable reloading and management

## New Features & Major Changes

### SSH Management

* Introduced `SSHConnectionManager` class for robust SSH connection pooling and command execution
* Centralized SSH credentials and host management via environment variables
* Improved error handling and connection cleanup for SSH operations

### Logging System Improvements

* Refined logger setup to prevent duplicate handlers
* Improved log directory creation and management
* More detailed and consistent startup and event logging

### Twitch & Spotify Integration

* Expanded Twitch EventSub and API event handling
* Improved Twitch token refresh logic and error handling
* Enhanced Spotify token management and error reporting
* Removed Spotify token refresh logic and associated scheduled tasks from the bot, as token management has been migrated to a centralized system.
* More robust handling of Twitch and Spotify API credentials
* Enhanced the `!songrequest` command to support YouTube links; the bot will now automatically find the corresponding track on Spotify and add it to the queue.
* Added support for direct Spotify track links to the `!songrequest` command, allowing users another method to queue specific songs.
* Added an automated pre-ad warning system; the bot will now notify the chat 5 minutes prior to an upcoming ad break.
* Implemented a chat notification to inform viewers whenever a scheduled ad break has been snoozed.

### Websocket & External Service Enhancements

* Added & expanded websocket event handlers for Fourthwall, Ko-fi, Patreon, and weather data
* Improved integration with tipping services (StreamElements, StreamLabs)
* More modular websocket and event processing functions
* Refactored StreamElements token management. The bot no longer handles token refreshes on reconnection; this process is now automatically managed by the web dashboard's OAuth2 login flow, simplifying connection logic.
* Enhanced HypeRate heart rate monitoring with persistent websocket connection, improved error handling, and automatic reconnection for reliable real-time data.

### Command & Event Handler Refactoring

* Refactored and expanded command handler structure for maintainability
* Improved global variable initialization and usage across commands
* More modular and organized event and command processing
* Expanded support for custom commands and user interaction features
* Enhanced custom commands using the `(count)` variable. Users can now specify a number in the command message (e.g., `!cmd 5`) to increment the count by that amount, while the command defaults to incrementing by 1 if no number is given.
* Enhanced custom commands using the `(usercount)` variable. Users can now specify a number in the command message (e.g., `!cmd 5`) to increment the per-user count by that amount, while the command defaults to incrementing by 1 if no number is given.
* Added a new chat response variable, `(userstreak)`, for channel point redemptions. This variable tracks and displays a user's uninterrupted claim streak for a reward, which resets if another user claims it.
* Added a `!skip` command for the song request system, allowing moderators to skip the current track.
* Added owner-only custom commands with cooldowns and moderator/streamer override. Members can have custom commands that only the named owner may run, each with a cooldown. Moderators or the streamer can still run or override these commands when needed.
* **Overhauled lurk command** with community-requested timer toggle functionality
  * Added configurable timer option that can be enabled/disabled via website
  * When timer is enabled: Shows accumulated lurk time and resets timer on subsequent uses
  * When timer is disabled: Simple lurk acknowledgment without time tracking
  * Enhanced lurk time display to include years and improved calculation precision for long durations
  * Optimized code by creating a reusable `format_lurk_time()` function to eliminate duplication across `!lurk`, `!lurking`, `!lurklead`, and `!unlurk` commands
* Added a new `!userslurking` command that displays the count of users currently lurking
* Added a new `!gamble` command allowing users to bet points on games including coinflip, blackjack, and roulette.

### Backend & Technical Improvements

* Improved environment variable reloading with `reload_env_vars()`
* More robust MySQL connection handling and error management
* Expanded and improved data structure initialization for runtime state
* Enhanced signal handling for graceful shutdown (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
* Improved error handling and logging throughout the codebase
* Implemented a secure `safe_math` function for custom commands to prevent arbitrary code execution by safely evaluating only basic arithmetic operations.
* Enhanced the security of the existing `fetch_api_response` function; it now converts returned JSON data to a string to mitigate potential vulnerabilities in custom commands.
* Optimized the `check_stream_online()` function to reduce Twitch API calls by conditionally calling the channels endpoint only when the stream is offline.
* Optimized the `channel_point_rewards()` function to use `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` for better database performance.
* Optimized the `known_users()` function to use batch database inserts and reduce round trips for better performance when handling moderators and VIPs.
* Optimized the `check_premium_feature()` function to parallelize independent API calls using `asyncio.gather`, reducing execution time.
* Optimized the `make_stream_marker` function with input validation, timeout handling, enhanced error logging, and simplified error handling for better reliability.
* Optimized the `track_watch_time` function to use batch database operations, reducing query count from O(n) to O(1) for better performance when tracking watch time for multiple active users.
* Optimized the `return_the_action_back` function to use dynamic SQL and reduce code duplication for better maintainability.
* Optimized ad settings caching to refresh every minute, ensuring up-to-date information while maintaining performance benefits.
* Fixed snooze feature in ad system to prevent sending duplicate messages when ads are snoozed and upcoming notifications are checked.
* Cleaned up unnecessary `global` declarations in module-level and function scopes for better code organization and adherence to Python best practices.
* Optimized the `subscribe_to_events` function to use concurrent API calls with `asyncio.gather` for faster Twitch EventSub subscriptions, replacing sequential loops.
* Fixed the condition for `channel.chat.user_message_hold` EventSub subscription by correcting the user_id field to resolve validation errors.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed issues with logger handler duplication
* Improved error handling for API and websocket failures
* Fixed and improved timed message and scheduled task management
* Resolved a bug that could cause timed messages to spam the chat, ensuring they now adhere to their configured schedules.
* Addressed minor issues in command and event processing logic
* **Fixed AI Song Request Confirmation:** Addressed an issue where the AI Talking Module would incorrectly confirm song requests made in natural language. The AI will now respond by reminding the user it is a chatbot and will direct them to use the proper `!songrequest` command to queue music.
* **Improved Spotify Song Request Accuracy:** Fixed an issue where the song request feature would sometimes queue an instrumental version of a track. The logic has been updated to better prioritize the original, non-instrumental version.
* **Fixed !convert Command API Tracking:** Migrated API usage tracking from file-based to database-based system to resolve file path errors and improve reliability
* Removed unnecessary warning log in `periodic_watch_time_update` function to prevent log spam when no active users are found.

## Backend Structure Updates

* Added/expanded data structures for SSH, websocket, and event management
* Improved asynchronous task management by storing looped tasks (e.g., ad checks, timed messages) in a named dictionary. This allows for more granular control, including the ability to cancel specific tasks by name.
* Improved code organization and modularity for future development
