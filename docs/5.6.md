# Changelog - Version 5.6 (2025-11-08)

## Version Information
* Updated version from 5.5 to 5.6
* Code optimization in version command premium status logic

## New Features & Major Changes
* Added the `check_premium_feature` function that returns premium tier 4000 for bot owner, enabling optimized premium status checks.
* Added support for `OBS_EVENT_RECEIVED` event handling.
* **Custom Variables for Channel Point Rewards**
  - (fortune): Replaces with a random fortune message.
  - (lotto): Replaces with randomly generated lotto numbers.
  - (tts): Sends the user input to text-to-speech (removes from message).
  - (tts.message): Sends the final complete message to both chat and text-to-speech.
  - Note: It's no longer reward name now, you have to manually assign the custom variable in the message section on the dashboard.

## AI System
* The AI system has been rewritten to use OpenAI for chat and agent functionality. This includes fetching system instructions from the API and using OpenAI's chat completion APIs for bot responses.

## New Commands
* **`!obs`** - New moderator command for direct OBS integration using the Specter OBS Connector app, enabling control and interaction with OBS events with the OBSConnector app.

## Code Improvements
* Simplified the premium tier check in the `!version` command to directly check for bot owner status first, eliminating redundant conditions.
* If your channel doesn't have a subscription active, the message that would post to chat saying you don't have a subscription has been removed (user feedback request).
* An extra catch has been added for the bot owner to perform premium actions without the channel needing a premium subscription.
