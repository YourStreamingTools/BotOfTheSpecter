# Changelog - Version 4.7 (2024-09-19)

## Enhancements & Updates

* **API Token Management:**
  * Updated `VERSION` variable to "4.7" to track the bot version.
  * `WEATHER_API` removed as it's no longer needed as it's now done via the Specter API.

* **WebSocket Connection Enhancements:**
  * Added functionality for connecting to the Specter WebSocket server (`specter_websocket()` method).
  * Handled events for:
    * Connection to the WebSocket server (`@sio.event connect`).
    * Disconnection from the WebSocket server (`@sio.event disconnect`).
    * Receiving messages from the WebSocket server (`@sio.event message`).
      * Stream events: `STREAM_ONLINE`, `STREAM_OFFLINE`, `FOURTHWALL` and `WEATHER_DATA`.
    * Introduced retry logic with sleep for WebSocket reconnections.

## Command & Event Improvements

* **Gift Sub Event:**
  * Updated the processing of `is_anonymous` and `cumulative_total` within the `process_giftsub_event()` function.

* **Fourthwall Event Processing:**
  * Added functionality to handle Fourthwall events with various event types such as:
    * `ORDER_PLACED`: Logs details about orders placed, including the item, quantity, and total price. Sends a notification message to the channel.
    * `DONATION`: Logs donations and includes any message from the donor. Sends a notification message to the channel.
    * `GIVEAWAY_PURCHASED`: Logs purchases of giveaway items and tracks the status and winner of each gift. Sends a notification message to the channel for each gift.
    * `SUBSCRIPTION_PURCHASED`: Logs new subscriptions and sends a notification message to the channel about the subscription details.

* **Todo Command:**
  * Added a new `todo` command to manage a user's personal todo list with the following actions:
    * **Add**: Users can add tasks with an optional category.
    * **Edit**: Users can edit existing tasks by specifying the task ID and new description.
    * **Complete**: Users can mark tasks as complete.
    * **Remove**: Tasks can be marked for removal, pending user confirmation.
    * **Confirm**: Confirms pending task removal.
    * **View**: View details of a specific task using its task ID.
  * The command ensures proper validation of inputs and permissions for certain actions like adding, editing, and removing tasks.
  * Database operations for `todos` and `categories` are now included for task management.

* **Error Handling:**
  * Improved error handling and logging for `event_command_error` when commands are on cooldown.
  * Commands now notify users if they attempt a command that is still on cooldown.
  * Added error logging for key errors and unexpected exceptions during event processing.

* **Weather Command Overhaul:**
  * Refactored the `weather_command` to pull weather data directly from the Specter API using the location information provided in the request.
  * Added support for API request failure with proper logging.
  * Removed the redundant manual logic for fetching weather and sending WebSocket notifications.

* **Kiss Command:**
  * Improved fetching and logging of `kiss_count` for the target user.
  * Cleaned up redundant code and streamlined the fetching of `kiss_count` from the database.

## Other Notable Changes

* Removed unnecessary imports and cleaned up code structure, such as:
  * Removal of the `as commands` in the `from twitchio.ext import commands` import.
  * Import simplification across different modules.

* **System Improvements:**
  * Added cooldown rates for commands to manage command spam.
