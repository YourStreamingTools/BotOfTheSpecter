# Changelog - Version 5.5 (2025-10-18)

## Version Information
* Updated version from 5.4 to 5.5
* Enhanced chat messaging system to support Twitch ChatBot Badge Icon and Shared Chat

## New Features & Major Changes

### Twitch Chat Integration
* Implemented Twitch API-based chat message sending to enable the new ChatBot Badge Icon in chat messages
* Added the `send_chat_message` function using Twitch API endpoint for sending messages
* Updated all bot functions to use the new `send_chat_message` function for consistent ChatBot badge display
* This allows the bot to display the official ChatBot badge when sending messages in chat
* Fixed Twitch shared chat functionality to validate message origin using `source-room-id` tag
  * Added validation to check `source-room-id` from IRC tags against the running bot's `CHANNEL_ID`
  * Bot only processes messages from users in the configured channel, rejecting messages from users in other channels within shared chat sessions
  * Ensures messages from external shared chat users are ignored
  * Prevents bot from responding to cross-channel shared chat messages while maintaining compatibility with legitimate channel messages

### System Update Handler Enhancement
* Enhanced SYSTEM_UPDATE websocket event handlers in the bot with API-based version checking
* Implemented dynamic version retrieval from `https://api.botofthespecter.com/versions` API endpoint
* Added intelligent version comparison logic that selects appropriate version based on SYSTEM variable (beta_version for BETA, stable_version for STABLE)
* Improved update notifications to only send chat messages when versions actually differ, preventing unnecessary spam

### Stream Bingo Twitch Extension Integration
* Added comprehensive Stream Bingo Twitch Extension support with WebSocket integration
* Implemented `stream_bingo_websocket()` function for persistent WebSocket connection to Stream Bingo API
* Added `process_stream_bingo_message()` function to handle all bingo game events including game start/end, player joins, bingo registrations, and voting
* Integrated database storage for bingo games and winners with automatic tracking of game status, player rankings, and event data
* Added support for various bingo event types: GAME_STARTED, GAME_ENDED, EVENT_CALLED, PLAYER_JOINED, BINGO_REGISTERED, EXTRA_CARD_WITH_BITS, VOTE_STARTED, VOTE_ENDED, and ALL_EVENTS_CALLED
* Enables seamless integration with Stream Bingo extension for interactive bingo games during streams

### New Commands
* **`!wsstatus`** - New moderator command to check WebSocket server connection status for the channel instance
  * Displays "Connected" or "Disconnected" status for the internal system WebSocket connection
  * Allows moderators to diagnose websocket connectivity issues in real-time
  * Helps determine if bot features requiring websocket connection are functional
  * 30-second cooldown with permission-based access control
  * Automatically added to builtin_commands database table

### Game Death Ignore System
* Added game death ignore settings allowing streamers to specify games where deaths should not be counted
* Updated `!deaths` command to check if the current game is on the ignore list and notify users that deaths are not counted for ignored games
* Updated `!deathadd` command to prevent adding deaths for ignored games and notify users accordingly
* Integrated with dashboard modules for easy management of ignored games list

### WebSocket Reconnection & Connection Management Enhancement
* Completely overhauled WebSocket reconnection system for improved reliability and server reboot compatibility
* Implemented unlimited retry attempts with fixed 60-second delays optimized for server reboot scenarios
* Added comprehensive connection state validation and clean disconnection handling before reconnection attempts
* Enhanced error handling with exponential backoff jitter to prevent connection storms
* Implemented `is_websocket_connected()` helper function for centralized connection status checking
* Added `!wsstatus` command to allow users and moderators to check WebSocket connection status in real-time
* Enhanced `websocket_notice()` function with automatic connection validation to prevent failed notifications
* Updated weather command to use new standardized connection checking system
* Added comprehensive logging for all WebSocket connection events and state changes
* Removed unused helper functions (`get_websocket_status`, `force_websocket_reconnect`) to clean up codebase
* Ensures robust reconnection handling that maintains full bot functionality after server maintenance or network interruptions

### Dynamic Command Cooldown System
* Implemented database-driven command cooldown system for all builtin commands, replacing hardcoded `@commands.cooldown` decorators
* Added `check_cooldown()` function to enforce cooldowns per bucket type (global, moderator, or per-user) with configurable rates and time windows
* Added `add_usage()` function to track command usage history for analytics and cooldown management
* Updated all builtin commands in the bot to fetch cooldown settings from the `builtin_commands` database table including `cooldown_rate`, `cooldown_time`, and `cooldown_bucket`
* Enabled dynamic cooldown adjustments without requiring bot redeployment - administrators can modify cooldowns through the database
* Implemented bucket-based cooldown logic where commands can have different cooldown behaviors:
  - **Global bucket**: Cooldown applies to all users collectively
  - **Moderator bucket**: Separate cooldown for moderators vs regular users
  - **User bucket**: Individual cooldown per user
* Enhanced command permission and status checking with database-driven configuration
* Added comprehensive error handling and database connection management for all command executions
* Maintains backward compatibility while providing flexibility for future cooldown management features

## Bug Fixes
* Fixed WebSocket reconnection issues where "half of the system doesn't work" after reconnection by implementing proper connection state management
* Resolved inappropriate retry delays that didn't account for server reboot timing requirements
