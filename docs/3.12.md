# Changelog - Version 3.12 (2024-04-12)

## Added

* Introduced a new feature: the `!steam` command. This command enables users to verify if the currently played game is available on the Steam store. If the game is listed, a direct link to its Steam page is provided in the chat.

```py
@commands.command(name='steam')
    async def steam_command(self, ctx):
        global current_game
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            response = await session.get("http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetAppList/v2")
            if response.status == 200:
                data = await response.json()
                steam_app_list = {app['name'].lower(): app['appid'] for app in data['applist']['apps']}
            else:
                await ctx.send("Failed to fetch Steam games list.")
                return
        # Normalize the game name to lowercase to improve matching chances
        game_name_lower = current_game.lower()
        if game_name_lower in steam_app_list:
            game_id = steam_app_list[game_name_lower]
            store_url = f"https://store.steampowered.com/app/{game_id}"
            await ctx.send(f"{current_game} is over on steam, you can get it here: {store_url}")
        else:
            await ctx.send("This game is not available on Steam.")
```
