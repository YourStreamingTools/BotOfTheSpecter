# Version 2.6 (2024-03-21)

## Changed

* **Lurking Command**
  * Improved lurking command to calculate months accurately.
    * Refactored code logic for month calculation.
      * Old code:

        ```python
        days, seconds = divmod(elapsed_time.total_seconds(), 86400)
        hours, remainder = divmod(seconds, 3600)
        minutes, seconds = divmod(remainder, 60)
        ```

      * New code:

        ```python
        days = elapsed_time.days
        months = days // 30
        days %= 30
        hours, seconds = divmod(elapsed_time.seconds, 3600)
        minutes, seconds = divmod(seconds, 60)
        ```

  * Updated `say` part of the command to include months.
    * Old code:

      ```python
      periods = [("days", int(days)), ("hours", int(hours)), ("minutes", int(minutes)), ("seconds", int(seconds))]
      ```

    * New code:

      ```python
      periods = [("months", int(months)), ("days", int(days)), ("hours", int(hours)), ("minutes", int(minutes)), ("seconds", int(seconds))]
      ```

## Followage Command Changes

* Enhanced followage command to handle cases where user does not follow the channel.
  * Added condition to display appropriate message when user does not follow.
    * Old code:

      ```python
      chat_logger.info(f"{target_user} has been following for: {followage_text}.")
      await ctx.send(f"{target_user} has been following for: {followage_text}")
      ```

    * New code:

      ```python
      if f"{target_user} does not follow {CHANNEL_NAME}" in followage_text:
          await ctx.send(f"{target_user} does not follow {CHANNEL_NAME}.")
          chat_logger.info(f"{target_user} does not follow {CHANNEL_NAME}.")
      else:
          chat_logger.info(f"{target_user} has been following for: {followage_text}.")
          await ctx.send(f"{target_user} has been following for: {followage_text}")
      ```

## Logging

* Added logging for followage command.
  * Logged followage text using `api_logger`.
    * Code:

      ```python
      api_logger.info(f"{followage_text}")
      ```
