        <p>While we use <strong>Twitch</strong> as the login feature for our system ("Sign in with Twitch"), you remain responsible for ensuring that information associated with your account is accurate and kept up to date. This includes keeping your Twitch account information current, as we may rely on Twitch-linked details to provide services, communicate with you, and deliver account-related notices.</p>
        <p>If your Twitch-linked details change, you may need to log out and log back in to ensure our system picks up the updated information.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for keeping your account information up to date and for any activity that occurs through your account access.</p>

        <p>Abuse and enforcement: configuring the bot to spam (including via auto messages) and then reporting the bot, or otherwise attempting to misuse reporting/enforcement processes, may result in your profile/account being restricted or banned on our system and access removed at the discretion of <strong>YourStreamingTools</strong>.</p>
