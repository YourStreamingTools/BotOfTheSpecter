        <h2>3. Information we collect</h2>
    <h3 class="subpoint">3.1 Personal information</h3>
        <p>We collect information you provide directly to us (for example: name, email, billing address) when you register, make purchases, subscribe to newsletters, or contact us.</p>
        <p>We also use <strong>Twitch</strong> as our login provider ("Sign in with Twitch"). When you authenticate with Twitch, <strong>Twitch Interactive, Inc.</strong> may provide us with certain account information associated with your Twitch account (such as your Twitch user ID, username/display name, and the email address linked to your Twitch account where available/authorised). Your use of Twitch is governed by Twitch’s policies, including their <a href="https://legal.twitch.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://legal.twitch.com/legal/terms-of-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="subpoint">3.2 Usage data</h3>
        <p>We automatically collect information about how you interact with our Site and services (including our dashboard and related ecosystem pages). This data helps us operate the service, keep it secure, troubleshoot issues, and understand how our features are used.</p>
        <p>Usage data may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Log and device data:</strong> IP address, browser type and version, device type, operating system, language and regional settings, user agent, and approximate location derived from IP address.</li>
            <li><strong>Session and interaction data:</strong> pages viewed, buttons/links clicked, timestamps, referring/exit URLs, session identifiers, and authentication-related events (e.g., login/logout) to help prevent fraud and unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical and performance data:</strong> error reports, diagnostics, response times, and other performance metrics used for reliability monitoring and debugging.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3 class="subpoint">3.3 Payment information</h3>
        <p>We use third-party payment processors for transactions. We record transaction references and receipts but do not store full card details on our servers.</p>
        <p>For services that we operate and bill directly, we use <strong>Stripe</strong> as our payment processor. Stripe’s legal terms and policies are available at <a href="https://stripe.com/au/legal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://stripe.com/au/legal</a>.</p>
        <p>For <strong>BotOfTheSpecter Premium</strong> features/perks, we use <strong>Twitch subscription services</strong>. A subscription to the bot developer <strong>Lachlan</strong> (<strong>gfaUnDead</strong>, <a href="https://twitch.tv/gfaundead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://twitch.tv/gfaundead</a>) grants you premium perks for BotOfTheSpecter for as long as you remain subscribed to the developer’s Twitch channel.</p>

        <p>We use cookies and similar technologies (such as local storage and session storage) to help our Site function, remember your preferences, improve performance, and understand how our services are used.</p>
        <p>Cookies and tracking technologies we use may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strictly necessary cookies:</strong> required for core functionality such as session management, login/authentication, security protections, and enabling key site features.</li>
            <li><strong>Preference cookies:</strong> used to remember settings you choose (for example, display preferences) so you don’t have to re-enter them each time.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics and measurement:</strong> used to understand traffic and feature usage so we can improve reliability and user experience. Where required by law, we will request consent before using non-essential analytics cookies.</li>

    <section id="sharing">
        <h2>6. Sharing your information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We share or disclose personal information only when necessary to operate our services, provide requested features, comply with legal obligations, or protect the security and integrity of our systems.</p>
        <p>Data that we store on our servers is hosted in <strong>Australia</strong>. In general, personal data stored on our servers does not leave our servers except in limited situations such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legal requests:</strong> where we are required to disclose information under applicable law, including lawful requests from government authorities (including from another country where applicable legal processes apply).</li>
            <li><strong>GDPR data export delivery:</strong> when you request an export via our <strong>Export my Data</strong> feature or via a manual GDPR request, we will send your export as a ZIP file to the email address linked to your Twitch account (or otherwise provided/verified). For security, the download is available for a limited time (currently up to <strong>7 days</strong>); after that, the export is removed and you will need to request a new export.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment processing:</strong> when you purchase services, relevant transaction information is shared with our payment processors (for example, <strong>Stripe</strong>) to process payments and prevent fraud. We do not receive or store full card details.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where we use third-party service providers (for example, payment processors or email delivery providers), they process personal information only as needed to provide services to us and are required to protect it.</p>
    </section>
    <br />
    <section id="retention">
        <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
        <p>We keep personal data only for as long as it is reasonably necessary to provide our services, fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and protect the security and integrity of our systems.</p>
        <p>Retention depends on the type of data and why we collected it. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account and profile data:</strong> retained while you maintain an account with us so we can provide the services you request. If your access is terminated or your account is closed, we may retain limited data for compliance, fraud prevention, security, and dispute resolution.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage, security, and diagnostic logs:</strong> retained for a limited period as needed for security monitoring, abuse prevention (including spam investigations), troubleshooting, and service reliability.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment and transaction records:</strong> where applicable, we retain transaction references/receipts and related accounting records as required for financial compliance and audit purposes. We do not store full card details on our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>GDPR data exports:</strong> when you request an export, the generated ZIP export is made available for download for a limited time (currently up to <strong>7 days</strong>) and is then removed; you can request a new export if needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where retention is required by law (including tax, accounting, or regulatory requirements), or where we need to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims, we may retain relevant information for longer.</p>

    <section id="rights">
        <h2>8. Your rights under GDPR</h2>

        </ul>
        <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:gdpr@yourstreamingtools.com">gdpr@yourstreamingtools.com</a>. To protect your privacy and security, we may need to verify your identity before completing your request. We aim to respond within the timeframes required by applicable law (generally within one month, and may be extended where permitted).</p>
        <p>You may also lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority (supervisory authority) if you believe our processing of your personal data infringes applicable law.</p>
        <h3 class="subpoint">8.1 Export my Data (automated download)</h3>
        <p>If you would like to access or export the personal data we currently hold about your account/profile, you can use the <strong>Export my Data</strong> button available on the profile page across our ecosystem. When you click <strong>Export my Data</strong>, our system automatically collects the information currently stored about your account/profile, packages it into a ZIP file, and emails it to the email address linked to your Twitch account (this address is shown when you click the export button).</p>
        <p>If the email address shown is not correct, please either update your email address on Twitch, log out and log back into the dashboard site, and try again. Alternatively, you can email us at <a href="mailto:gdpr@yourstreamingtools.com">gdpr@yourstreamingtools.com</a> to request your export manually.</p>

        <h2>9. Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable technical and organisational measures designed to protect personal data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure, or access.</p>

            <li><strong>Operational safeguards:</strong> applying security updates, using least-privilege principles, and maintaining backup and recovery practices appropriate to the service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are responsible for keeping your account access secure (for example, protecting your Twitch account and any devices you use to access our services).
