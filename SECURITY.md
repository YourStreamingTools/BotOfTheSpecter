## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please reach out directly to any project team member on Discord when reporting a security vulnerability, or you can email code@botofthespecter.com.

We make every effort to respond as soon as possible, although it may take a day or two for us to sync internally and determine the severity of the report and its impact.
Please, do not use a public facing channel or GitHub issues to report sensitive security issues.

As part of our process, we will create a security advisory for the affected versions and disclose it publicly, usually two to four weeks after a releasing a version that addresses it.
